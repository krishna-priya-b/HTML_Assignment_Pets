    <h1>Pets</h1>
    <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism" target="_blank">altruistic</a>  basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics. </p>

        <p>These are just some examples of the many different types of pets that people may choose to keep as companions. Each type of pet has its own unique characteristics, care requirements, and interactions with humans. When considering a pet, it's essential to research and understand the specific needs of the species to provide the best care and companionship possible.</p>

        <h3>Effects of pets on their caregivers' health</h3>
        <p>It is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners; a 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was "suggestive" of a significant benefit. A recent dissent comes from a 2017 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation" target="_blank">RAND</a>  study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet per se failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount; instead, the study found children who were already prone to being healthy were more likely to get pets in the first place. Conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible.</p>
        <h3>Health risks</h3>
        <p>Health risks that are associated with pets include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Aggravation of allergies and asthma caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dander" target="_blank">dander</a> and fur or feathers</li>
            <li>Falling injuries. Tripping over pets, especially dogs causes more than 86,000 falls serious enough to prompt a trip to the emergency room each year in the United States. Among elderly and disabled people, these falls have resulted in life-threatening injuries and broken bones.</li>
            <li>Injury, mauling, and sometimes death caused by pet bites and attacks</li>
            <li>Disease or parasites due to animal hygiene problems, lack of appropriate treatment, and undisciplined behavior (feces and urine)</li>
            <li>Stress caused by the behavior of animals</li>
            <li>Anxiety over who will care for the animal should the owner no longer be able to do so</li>
        </ol>
